# Shield Insurance – Power BI Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the business performance of Shield Insurance using Power BI. The goal was to convert raw insurance data into meaningful insights that help understand customer growth, revenue trends, and performance across different age groups, regions, and sales channels.

The dashboard is designed to support business and strategy teams by providing a clear and interactive view of key metrics rather than just static numbers.

## Problem Statement

Shield Insurance had large volumes of customer and revenue data, but there was no centralized way to:

* Track real daily growth trends
* Compare current performance with the previous month
* Identify high-performing and underperforming segments

This made decision-making slower and less data-driven.

---

## Objectives

* Build an interactive Power BI dashboard
* Calculate **daily customer growth** and **daily revenue growth** using proper time-intelligence logic
* Enable **Last Month (LM) comparison** without depending on date filters
* Analyze performance by **age group, region, and sales channel**
* Present insights in a clear, business-friendly format

---

## Key KPIs

* Total Revenue
* Total Customers
* Daily Customer Growth
* Daily Revenue Growth
* Peak Month
* Best & Least Performing Age Groups
* Regional Performance

## Key Insights

* March is the highest revenue-generating month, showing seasonality
* The 35–44 age group contributes the most to customers and revenue
* Offline agents are the main source of customer acquisition
* Online website customers generate higher revenue per policy
* Metro cities perform strongly, while tier-2 cities show growth potential

## Tools & Technologies

* Power BI
* DAX (Time Intelligence)
